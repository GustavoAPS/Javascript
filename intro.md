# Javascript

JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for making web pages interactive. It is a multi-paradigm language, supporting event-driven, functional, and object-oriented programming styles.

## First Steps

The easiest way of running javascript is in the browser console, open the browser console and type the code bellow in the console tab.

```javascript
alert("Hello world")
```

Evaluate variable and print if it corresponds to the text.

```javascript
let js = 'amazing'

if(js === 'amazing') alert('Javascript is Fun')
```

We can make math operations in the console too, it will work just fine.

```javascript
40+3+90-11
```
